### What this is:
- Small collection of documents about the PPC-IOP ASIC
- Simple PPC patch with tools to help with hardware exploration.
- Toolchain build scripts

### What this not(yet):
- A complete SDK
- A PPC module loader

### Requirements:
- PS2 75K or newer
- PS2SDK installed
- 3.3V USB-TTL adapter
- Connection to PPC-IOP UART (see docs/UART.md)

### Building:
1. Install PS2SDK build requirements if you haven't already. (gcc/clang, make, cmake, patch, git, etc)
2. Make sure the PS2DEV environment variable is set. The toolchain buildscripts will install to the PS2DEV directory
3. Build binutils for PPC with 001-binutils.sh 
```
./buildscripts/toolchain/001-binutils.sh
```
4. Build GCC for PPC with 002-gcc-stage1.sh 
```
./buildscripts/toolchain/002-gcc-stage1.sh
```
5. Once the toolchain is built and installed you can simply run `make` in the root directory and both the patch and patch loader will be built
6. Open a serial monitor of your choosing and set the baud rate to 57600. When the PS2 is powered on or reset "D E C K A R D compiled xxxxx" should appear in the serial monitor. If it does not, check your connection and ensure the baud is set correctly.
7. Run patch_loader.elf via ps2link or any other means of launching homebrew. You should see the following in your serial monitor:
```

### Special Thanks
- Wisi for allowing me to incorporate and build upon their work from dpLibMod. Without Wisi's initial work, none of this would exist.
- Nocash for providing an invaluable resource for all things PS1 (https://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm)
